# Placeholder
Use loading placeholders (otherwise known as "skeletons") for your components
or pages to indicate something may still be loading

## About
Placeholders can be used to enhance the experience of your application.
They’re built only with HTML and CSS, meaning you don’t need any JavaScript to create them.
You will, however, need some custom JavaScript to toggle their visibility.
Their appearance, color, and sizing can be easily customized with our utility classes.

## Example
In the example below, we take a typical card component and recreate it with placeholders applied to create a “loading card”.
Size and proportions are the same between the two.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Example" story={stories.Example} />
</Canvas>

## Width
You can change the ```width``` through grid column classes, width utilities, or inline styles.

<Canvas isColumn>
    <Story name="WidthGrid" story={stories.WidthGrid} />
    <Story name="WidthUtilities" story={stories.WidthUtilities} />
    <Story name="WidthInlineStyles" story={stories.WidthInlineStyles} />
</Canvas>

## Color
By default, the ```Placeholder``` uses ```currentColor```. This can be overriden with a custom color or utility class.

<Canvas isColumn>
    <Story name="ColorDefault" story={stories.ColorDefault} />
    <Story name="ColorPrimary" story={stories.ColorPrimary} />
    <Story name="ColorSecondary" story={stories.ColorSecondary} />
    <Story name="ColorSuccess" story={stories.ColorSuccess} />
    <Story name="ColorDanger" story={stories.ColorDanger} />
    <Story name="ColorWarning" story={stories.ColorWarning} />
    <Story name="ColorInfo" story={stories.ColorInfo} />
    <Story name="ColorLight" story={stories.ColorLight} />
    <Story name="ColorDark" story={stories.ColorDark} />
</Canvas>

## Sizing
The size of ```Placeholders``` are based on the typographic style of the parent element.
Customize them with sizing props: ```lg```, ```sm```, or ```xs```.

<Canvas isColumn>
    <Story name="SizeDefault" story={stories.SizeDefault} />
    <Story name="SizeLg" story={stories.SizeLg} />
    <Story name="SizeSm" story={stories.SizeSm} />
    <Story name="SizeXs" story={stories.SizeXs} />
</Canvas>

## Animation
Animate placeholders by setting the prop ```animation``` to ```glow``` or ```wave``` to better convey
the perception of something being actively loaded.

<Canvas isColumn>
    <Story name="AnimationWave" story={stories.AnimationWave} />
    <Story name="AnimationGlow" story={stories.AnimationGlow} />
</Canvas>


## Demo

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="Demo"
        args={{
            xs: 12,
            size: 'lg',
            bg: 'success',
        }}>
        {PlaceholderTemplate.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="Demo" />
